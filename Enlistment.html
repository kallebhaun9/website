	         <h2>Consequences of Dishonorable Discharge</h2>
           <p> If you receive anything below a general discharge you will receive consequences. The minimum consequence is not being able to serve in the military in the future. Most likely, you won’t be able to get any of the veteran’s benefits either. Receiving a worse discharge will include consequences of not being able to get GI bill benefits and VA housing programs along with the previous consequences. The worst discharge you can recieve: dishonorable discharge, received for murder, fraud, desertion, treason, espionage, and/or sexual assault, will opt you out of all benefits, including government benefits like welfare, and personal civilian rights, you will face a prison sentence along with fines. You would have trouble finding any sort of employment, the exact opposite of the reasons you would initially come to enlist. A dishonorable discharge is treated as a felony.</p>
